As a prominent member of the QAnon community since the beginning, and one completely steeped in online culture, Neon has been censored, deplatformed, slandered and maligned in a way few others have experienced, precisely for the reason that few are able to effectively relay the message of Q in such an approachable and engaging way. After becoming convinced of the truthfulness of Q himself, Neon, as a storyteller at heart, has taken his skills as a screenwriter and applied them to telling one of the greatest stories humanity has ever known, even as it unfolds in real time. Through collecting and observing the disparate and high-level complexities of modernity while having a nose for sniffing out Deep State actors and criminals, Neon cuts through the MSM spin, and synthesizes the truth down into potent, powerful, and occasionally prescient stories. His first book, Revolution Q, is the culmination of all his previous efforts, and one which he hopes will serve humanity well, moving into the future.\"",

It reveals an extraordinary movement underway, a battle of epic proportions. Whether you know it or not, you’re involved because the result of this battle will determine the fate of your children and future generations both in America and around the world. However, you may only be vaguely aware of QAnon or “Q,” if at all. If you value the truth, you will want to learn about the QAnon movement and the battle that is being waged on your behalf to protect you and your children from abuse and enslavement. The war between Good and Evil is no longer merely symbolic. Evil is being, tried and brought to justice in federal courts and military tribunals today. Criminally corrupt government leaders, celebrities, religious leaders, media figures, and corporate heads will be tried and punished for crimes involving treason, human trafficking, ritual sacrifice and unspeakable perversions. QAnon: An Invitation to The Great Awakening tells the history of an anonymous poster on the free-speech websites 4Chan and then 8Chan and how he (or perhaps they) built a following of millions of viewers worldwide. With an insider’s knowledge of the battle plan (see “The Plan to Save the World”), and “Q” level military intelligence clearance, QAnon’s communications are often cryptic and coded. QAnon is a master of the Socratic method, asking questions and imploring followers to do their own research, to be logical and to think for themselves.\",",

Using the metaphor of Neo taking the Red Pill in the movie The Matrix, they have become a force to reckon with in what is The Great Awakening. To Make America Great Again ( MAGA ) President Trump has to Drain The Swamp - and he is doing it against all opposition from the Deep State and the Fake News media. Taking the lid off the pyramid of power, 'President Trump And The New World Order' walks you through the veil behind which families such as the Rothschilds and Rockefellers have spent generations, both publicly and behind the scenes, manipulating governments, politicians, and ordinary people alike in order to build their New World Order. President Trump is under siege as outlets like CNN (referred to in this book as the Cabal News Network), continue to insist that he is unfit for the job. What they will never report - but what is revealed here, exclusively - is that President Donald Trump has friends in very high places, which is well documented in this book - along with proof of a prophecy about President Trump, and UFOs, and why that encounter has resulted in some truly radical changes for America and the entire world. This book provides new and rational insights into the many ways in which deceivers under the appearance of doing good have indeed created and indulged in a tremendous amount of evil. This book is the backstory about how the Deep State evolved - and how it will end.\",",
